# substitution-cipher---file-version
This Python script demonstrates a substitution cipher applied to a text file, where each letter is replaced with the previous letter in the English alphabet.

**How it Works**

The script creates a dictionary dict where each letter in the English alphabet is mapped to the previous letter.
The script opens an input file "input_file.txt" and reads its contents character by character.

Encryption:
For each character read from the input file:
If the character is a letter and exists in the dictionary, it is replaced with its corresponding previous letter.
If the character is not a letter, it remains unchanged.

The encrypted character is written to an output file "output_file.txt".
The encrypted character is also printed for demonstration.
When the end of the input file is reached, the script prints "End of file." and terminates.
Finally, the output file is closed.

Example Output:
Suppose the input file contains the text: "Hello, World!".

The script would encrypt each letter backward by one position:
"H" becomes "G"

"e" becomes "d"

"l" becomes "k"

"o" becomes "n"

"W" becomes "V"

"r" becomes "q"

"l" becomes "k"

"d" becomes "c"

"!" remains "!" (as it is not a letter)

The encrypted text is written to "output_file.txt", and each encrypted character is printed.
